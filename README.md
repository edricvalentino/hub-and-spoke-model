# hub-and-spoke-model
In this study, heuristic is used for the p-hub location problem. Metaheuristic of tabu search is applied to the solution method. 
This approach to combinatorial optimization is capable of examining several local optima, so that, overall, superior solutions are found. 
Least cost algorithms were used for nodes allocating processes. It calculates each city traffic cost to hubs and assigns the city to the hub with minimum cost. 
Solution method then implemented in Python for computational purposes.
